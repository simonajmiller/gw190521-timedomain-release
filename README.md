# gw190521-timedomain-release

This repository hosts scripts to download and plot the data in "GW190521: tracing imprints of spin-precession on the most massive black hole binary" (Miller et. al 2023) [WORK IN PROGRESS: add arxiv link once available]

Our dataset itself is available to on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6555145).
In this `README` we describe how to download all necessary data (i.e. posterior samples), run scripts to calculate supplementary data (i.e. waveform reconstructions), and generate all the figures presented in the paper.
